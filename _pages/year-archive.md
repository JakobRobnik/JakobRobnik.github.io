When not exploring the extrasolar planets, I also love exploring our own planet, especially its wild side. 


I love anything that involves mountains, from ski touring to climbing and hiking:

But even without the mountains, adventures are always fun, weather it is canyoning or exploring the caves:

I also like to travel, here is our recent trip to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan

and from hiking the High Sierra Trail:

But mostly it is nice to be in good company :D
